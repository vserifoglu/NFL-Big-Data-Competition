# Big Data Bowl 2026: Analytics Competition

##### Note: I am doing the universit trak ofr this compeitiont. 

## Overview

You are tasked to create a metric or video to analyze NFL player movement during the video frames **after the ball is thrown**.

**Start Date**: 2 months ago  
**Deadline**: 12 days to go

## Description

**Note**: This Big Data Bowl 2026 has two competitions. This competition is the **Analytics competition**. Learn more about the Prediction competition [here](link).

The downfield pass is the crown jewel of American sports. When the ball is in the air, anything can happen, like a touchdown, an interception, or a contested catch. The uncertainty and the importance of the outcome of these plays is what helps keep audiences on the edge of its seat.

The 2026 Big Data Bowl is designed to help the National Football League better understand player movement during the pass play, starting with **when the ball is thrown** and ending when the ball is either caught or ruled incomplete. 

For the offensive team, this means focusing on the targeted receiver, whose job is to move towards the ball landing location in order to complete a catch. For the defensive team, who could have several players moving towards the ball, their jobs are to both prevent the offensive player from making a catch, while also going for the ball themselves. This year's Big Data Bowl asks our fans to help track the movement of these players.

In the **Analytics Competition** of the Big Data Bowl, participants are tasked with describing player movement with the ball in the air in a way that is accessible to coaches and football fans. This could be making a new metric or in the comparison of team or player strategy. As is often the case in Big Data Bowl analytics competitions, participants are encouraged to focus on **one small aspect of the play**, as opposed to trying to capture every aspect of every play. This could include:

- The change of direction of a defensive player
- The acceleration of the receiver
- The way that defensive schemes free players up to make plays

## Timeline

- Generally analyze player movement
- Create player or team metrics for either the offensive or defensive units
- Evaluate other passing play topics

### **Broadcast Visualization Track**
Open to any Big Data Bowl participant, the goal of this track is to create an accessible, interesting, and novel visualization that uses the movement of players when the ball is in the air. 

**Note**: Participants in this track can use the data provided, but are also encouraged to overlay film from games (e.g., NFL YouTube).

## Scoring

All entries are evaluated on the following four components, where 0 is the lowest and 10 is the highest.

### Football Score (30%):
- Would NFL teams (or the league office) be able to use these results on a week-to-week basis?
- Does the analysis account for variables that make football data complex?
- Are the ideas unique?

### Data Science Score (30%):
- Is the work correct?
- Are claims backed up by data?
- Are the statistical models appropriate given the data?
- Are the analytical applications innovative?

### Writeup Score (20%):
- Is the Writeup well-written?
- Is the Writeup easy to follow?
- Is the motivation (metric, player evaluation, etc.) clearly defined?

### Data Visualization Score (20%):
- Are the charts and tables provided accessible?
- Are the charts and tables accurate?
- Are the charts and tables innovative?

**Note**: Participants are encouraged to show statistical code if it helps readers better understand their analyses. However, most code should be hidden in an Appendix. Any Writeup that doesn't use the player tracking data will not be scored.
# Competition FAQ: Data Clarifications

## Q1: Clarification on output data
**Question**:  
The output data, is this the data while the ball is explicitly in the air or is it the rest of the play? Is the time the receiver catches the ball the last frame in the output file or does the receiver catch the ball somewhere during the frames in the output file?

**Answer**:  
The output data is explicitly when the ball is in the air.  
The last frame of the output data is when the pass arrives (pass does not always result in a catch).

---

## Q2: Quick Question about Frames
**Question**:  
I hope this wasn't already covered somewhere in the data overview and I simply missed it, but I couldn't find any information about how much time elapses between each frame in the input and output files. Does the data contain a frame every second, a frame every half second, a frame every tenth of a second? Again, apologize if the information is actually somewhere and I just didn't see it.

**Answer**:  
Great question — a tenth of a second.

---

## Q3: Pass Forward Frame
**Question**:  
I was wondering which frame is the pass forward moment. Is it the last frame in the input data, or the first frame in the output data?

**Answer**:  
It is the first frame of the output.

---

## Q4: Competition focus and data split before and while the ball is in the air
**Question**:  
In this competition we have a lot of data from before the pass is thrown and a lot less data while the ball is airborne, specifically we have only (x,y) tuple for 5+ frames for 1 receiver and 0–8 defenders. Of course the topic is "understand player movement while the ball is in the air."

Now here is my question: Is the focus on what player movement before the throw tells us about movement while the ball is in the air, mainly use data while the ball is airborne to understand that specific aspect of the play, or are we more or less free to do whatever analysis we want as long as it's using this year's (tracking) data?

**Answer**:  
Ultimately, the focus is on the relationship between:
- Contextual information in the supplemental data
- Player movement before the ball is thrown
- Player movement after the ball is thrown

However, that does not mean your project must be a prediction of player x–y coordinates while the ball is in the air (goal of the prediction contest). You are free to focus on specific positions, specific situations in a game, or define "player movement" as something other than x–y coordinates (or anything else that relates to player movement with ball in air).

---

## Q5: Clarification on output data (similar to Q1)
**Question**:  
The output data, is this the data while the ball is explicitly in the air or is it the rest of the play? Is the time the receiver catches the ball the last frame in the output file or does the receiver catch the ball somewhere during the frames in the output file?

**Answer**:  
The output data is explicitly when the ball is in the air.  
The last frame of the output data is when the pass arrives (pass does not always result in a catch).
# My approach / working idea.
# Zone Coverage Auditing: The "Void Engine"

## 1. The Problem / Premise

In Zone Coverage, defensive success relies on structural discipline. A defender is responsible for a specific geometric area (a "Landmark"). However, standard NFL metrics often blame the defender closest to the catch for allowing a reception, even if that defender was covering for a teammate's mistake.

The premise of this project is to identify the root cause of defensive breakdowns: **The Void**. We distinguish between:

- **Chaos**: Scrambles/Broken Plays
- **Structure**: Scheme Failure

The goal is to detect moments where a defender drifts away from their assigned landmark in a structured dropback, creating an empty space that the offense exploits.

## 2. Engineering Architecture

We built a robust, production-grade Python pipeline designed for memory efficiency and data integrity.

### A. Schema Validation (`schemas.py`)

We utilize **Pandera** to enforce "Data Quality Gates" at every step of the pipeline.

- **Strict Filtering**: Only approved columns enter the engine; "junk data" is stripped immediately.
- **Type Safety**: Ensures coordinate data are floats and IDs are integers before math is performed.
- **Inheritance**: Schemas evolve from:
  `RawTracking` → `Preprocessed` → `FeatureEngineered` → `VoidResult`

### B. The Pipeline (`main.py` & `preprocessing.py`)

- **Lazy Loading**: We use Python Generators (`yield`) to stream data one week at a time, keeping RAM usage low even when processing millions of frames.
- **Vectorization**: All geometric calculations use NumPy broadcasting (SIMD) instead of loops, allowing us to process full seasons of tracking data in seconds.

## 3. Methodology & Physics

### Step 1: Context-Aware Landmarks (`features.py`)

We do not use static zones. We calculate **Dynamic Landmarks** that adapt to the field context:

- **The "Red Zone Squash"**: As the field shrinks near the Goal Line, landmarks automatically compress (e.g., a "Deep 1/2" Safety drops 9 yards instead of 18).
- **"Pattern Match" Logic**: We implemented **Dynamic Depth**. If a Zone Defender is deeper than their landmark (e.g., matching a vertical route), the engine adjusts their target depth to match their current depth, preventing false positives.

### Step 2: The Void Detector (`metrics.py`)

We utilize a **"Strict Liability"** algorithm that acts as a **Row Reducer**. It collapses the timeline to the exact moment of the catch and flags a "Void Penalty" only if:

1. **Drift**: The defender is > 5.0 yards away from their assigned geometric landmark.
2. **Absence**: The defender is > 3.0 yards away from the ball landing spot (Catch Point).
3. **Opportunity**: The pass was completed (or highly targetable).

## 4. Output Data Model

The pipeline generates two distinct datasets for different use cases:

| File Name                  | Granularity       | Purpose                                                                 |
| -------------------------- | ----------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `void_analysis_summary.csv` | 1 Row per Play    | **Analytical Reporting**. Contains the "Grade" for the play, EPA damage, and drift distance. Used for leaderboards and regression analysis. |
| `master_animation_data.csv` | 1 Row per Frame   | **Visualization**. Contains the full trajectory (x, y, s, dir) merged with the Void Penalty flags. Used to render animations where "guilty" defenders turn red. |

## 5. The Value (Big Data Bowl Context)

This project scores highly in three categories:

### Football Score
It answers the coach's question: "Did we lose this play because the scheme failed, or because Player X was undisciplined?" It quantifies the EPA cost of indiscipline.

### Data Science Score
It solves the "Pattern Matching" problem using dynamic geometry and creates a novel metric (`void_penalty`) that correlates with negative defensive outcomes.

### Engineering Score
The pipeline demonstrates professional MLOps practices: Schema validation, memory-safe streaming, modular architecture, and vectorized computation.

# 🏈 Big Data Bowl 2026: Dataset Inspection & Engineering Handbook

**Project:** The Void Engine (Zone Coverage Auditing)
**Domain:** NFL Player Tracking Data (Post-Snap/Post-Throw)
**Status:** VALIDATED (with documented constraints)

---

## 1. File Topology & Data Flow

The dataset is split into **Tracking Data** (Time-series) and **Context Data** (Play-level metadata).

### Directory Structure
* **`data/train/`**: Contains the raw tracking data.
    * `input_w[01-09].csv`: **Pre-throw** tracking data (frames leading up to the pass).
    * `output_w[01-09].csv`: **Post-throw** tracking data (frames where the ball is in the air).
    * *Note: Files are paired by Week. Week 1 Input matches Week 1 Output.*
* **`data/supplementary_data.csv`**: The "Rosetta Stone." Contains play-level labels (Coverages, EPA, Penalties).

### The "Stitch" & Time Sparsity
* **Temporal Ratio:** `Input` files are ~2.9x longer than `Output` files.
* **Frame Zeroing:** `input_*.csv` frames end at $N$. The first frame of `output_*.csv` is $1$. The pipeline offsets the output frames by $N$ to create a continuous timeline $1 \to N \to End$.

---

## 2. The "Ghost" Constraint (Attrition Analysis)

**Critical Finding:** The dataset is **Lossy**. Players present in the `Input` file (pre-throw) frequently disappear in the `Output` file (post-throw).

### The Survival Rules (Empirically Proven)
1.  **Targeted Receivers:** 100% Survival Rate. They never disappear.
2.  **Proximity Filter:** The dataset aggressively drops players far from the ball.
    * *Survivors* (Kept in data): Avg distance to landing spot = **8.4 yards**.
    * *Ghosts* (Dropped from data): Avg distance to landing spot = **19.8 yards**.
3.  **The "Danger Zone" (8-15 yards):**
    * There is a transition zone (8-15 yards from catch) where players *may* disappear.
    * *Implication:* If a defender is ~12 yards away from the catch, they might not be graded by the Void Engine because they do not exist in the dataframe.

**Engineering Decision:** The Void Engine treats "Ghosts" as **Exempt**. We assume if the NFL tracking system deemed them irrelevant enough to drop, they were not the primary cause of the defensive breakdown.

---

## 3. Coordinate System & Physics

**Warning:** Raw NFL data is non-standardized regarding direction. This pipeline enforces a **Left-to-Right** normalization.

### Normalization Logic
If `play_direction == 'left'`, the engine flips the geometry so the offense always drives from Left ($X=0$) to Right ($X=120$).

* **X-Axis:** $X_{new} = 120 - X_{raw}$
* **Y-Axis:** $Y_{new} = 53.3 - Y_{raw}$
* **Orientation/Dir:** $\theta_{new} = (\theta_{raw} + 180) \mod 360$

### Derived Geometry
* **Line of Scrimmage (LOS):** Calculated as `ball_land_x - pass_length`.
* **Depth:** $X_{player} - X_{LOS}$.
* **Compression Factor:** Used for "Red Zone Squash."
    $$\text{Compression} = \text{clip}\left(\frac{110 - \text{LOS}}{20}, 0.5, 1.0\right)$$

PHYSICS VARIABLES AVAILABILITY REPORT
=======================================

1. Column Existence Check:
   Input Files Missing: None (All present)
   Output Files Missing: ['s', 'a', 'dir', 'o']

2. Data Content Check (Are they full of NaNs?):
   [INPUT FILES]
     - s: 0.0% Nulls
     - a: 0.0% Nulls
     - dir: 0.0% Nulls
     - o: 0.0% Nulls

   [OUTPUT FILES]
     - s: COLUMN MISSING
     - a: COLUMN MISSING
     - dir: COLUMN MISSING
     - o: COLUMN MISSING

3. CRITICAL IMPLICATIONS:
   The Output files lack motion vectors.
   IMPACT 1 (Animation): You cannot use 'dir' arrows in visualization.
   IMPACT 2 (Normalization): 'data_preprocessor.py' tries to flip 'dir'/'o' for left-moving plays.
             If these columns are missing, that code block will crash.
   IMPACT 3 (Physics): You must DERIVE speed/direction from x,y changes if needed.
