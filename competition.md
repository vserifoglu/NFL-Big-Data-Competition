# Big Data Bowl 2026: Analytics Competition

##### Note: I am doing the universit trak ofr this compeitiont. 

## Overview

You are tasked to create a metric or video to analyze NFL player movement during the video frames **after the ball is thrown**.

**Start Date**: 2 months ago  
**Deadline**: 12 days to go

## Description

**Note**: This Big Data Bowl 2026 has two competitions. This competition is the **Analytics competition**. Learn more about the Prediction competition [here](link).

The downfield pass is the crown jewel of American sports. When the ball is in the air, anything can happen, like a touchdown, an interception, or a contested catch. The uncertainty and the importance of the outcome of these plays is what helps keep audiences on the edge of its seat.

The 2026 Big Data Bowl is designed to help the National Football League better understand player movement during the pass play, starting with **when the ball is thrown** and ending when the ball is either caught or ruled incomplete. 

For the offensive team, this means focusing on the targeted receiver, whose job is to move towards the ball landing location in order to complete a catch. For the defensive team, who could have several players moving towards the ball, their jobs are to both prevent the offensive player from making a catch, while also going for the ball themselves. This year's Big Data Bowl asks our fans to help track the movement of these players.

In the **Analytics Competition** of the Big Data Bowl, participants are tasked with describing player movement with the ball in the air in a way that is accessible to coaches and football fans. This could be making a new metric or in the comparison of team or player strategy. As is often the case in Big Data Bowl analytics competitions, participants are encouraged to focus on **one small aspect of the play**, as opposed to trying to capture every aspect of every play. This could include:

- The change of direction of a defensive player
- The acceleration of the receiver
- The way that defensive schemes free players up to make plays

## Submission Requirements

A valid submission must contain the following:

1. **Kaggle Writeup**
2. **Media Gallery**
3. **Attached Public Notebook** (University Track)
4. **Attached Public Video** (Broadcast Track)

To create a new Writeup, click on the "New Writeup" button [here](link). After you have saved your Writeup, you should see a "Submit" button in the top right corner.

Your final Submission must be made prior to the deadline. Any un-submitted or draft Writeups by the competition deadline will not be considered by the Judges.

**Note**: If you attach a private Kaggle Resource to your public Kaggle Writeup, your private Resource will automatically be made public after the deadline.

All of the content on Kaggle is written in Markdown. If you are copy-pasting from another application, like Word or your browser, you may need to clean up the markdown or HTML for things to display properly.

### 1. Kaggle Writeup

The Kaggle Writeup serves as your project report. This should include:
- A title
- A subtitle  
- A detailed analysis of your submission

You must select a Track for your Writeup in order to submit.

**Word Limit**: Your Writeup should not exceed 2000 words. Submissions over this limit may be subject to penalty.

The below assets must be attached to the Writeup to be eligible.

#### a. Media Gallery

This is where you should attach any images and/or videos associated with your submission. Writeups should contain **less than ten tables/figures**. Submissions over this limit may be subject to penalty.

You are allowed to submit any tables/figures directly into your Writeup via Markdown editor if preferred, but **a cover image in the media gallery is required** to submit your Writeup.

#### b. Public Notebook

Your code should be submitted as a public notebook in the Project Files field. Your notebook should be publicly accessible and not require a login or paywall. If you use a private Kaggle Notebook, it will automatically be made public after the deadline.

#### c. Video (required for Broadcast Visualization Track)

Attach your video to the Media Gallery. Videos should be **3 minutes or less**, and should be published to YouTube.

## Evaluation Criteria

Participants will select one of two tracks in which to submit:

### **University Track**
University students (college or grad students welcome) are allowed to submit to this track. Participants are challenged to:
- Generally analyze player movement
- Create player or team metrics for either the offensive or defensive units
- Evaluate other passing play topics

### **Broadcast Visualization Track**
Open to any Big Data Bowl participant, the goal of this track is to create an accessible, interesting, and novel visualization that uses the movement of players when the ball is in the air. 

**Note**: Participants in this track can use the data provided, but are also encouraged to overlay film from games (e.g., NFL YouTube).

## Scoring

All entries are evaluated on the following four components, where 0 is the lowest and 10 is the highest.

### Football Score (30%):
- Would NFL teams (or the league office) be able to use these results on a week-to-week basis?
- Does the analysis account for variables that make football data complex?
- Are the ideas unique?

### Data Science Score (30%):
- Is the work correct?
- Are claims backed up by data?
- Are the statistical models appropriate given the data?
- Are the analytical applications innovative?

### Writeup Score (20%):
- Is the Writeup well-written?
- Is the Writeup easy to follow?
- Is the motivation (metric, player evaluation, etc.) clearly defined?

### Data Visualization Score (20%):
- Are the charts and tables provided accessible?
- Are the charts and tables accurate?
- Are the charts and tables innovative?

**Note**: Participants are encouraged to show statistical code if it helps readers better understand their analyses. However, most code should be hidden in an Appendix. Any Writeup that doesn't use the player tracking data will not be scored.
