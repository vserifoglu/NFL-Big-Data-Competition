PART 3: DEEP SAMPLE ANALYSIS (WEEK 1)
-------------------------------------
Loading Sample Pair:
  - input_2023_w01.csv
  - output_2023_w01.csv

3.1 Column Consistency Check:
⚠️ Schema Mismatch detected!
Only in Input: {'player_name', 's', 'player_to_predict', 'o', 'player_role', 'ball_land_y', 'player_height', 'play_direction', 'player_weight', 'player_side', 'absolute_yardline_number', 'dir', 'ball_land_x', 'a', 'player_position', 'player_birth_date', 'num_frames_output'}
Only in Output: set()

3.2 Sample Statistics (Week 1):
Input Rows (Pre-Throw): 285,714
Output Rows (Post-Throw): 32,088

3.3 Stitching Logic Inspection:
Sample Play (2023090700 - 101):
  - Max Input Frame: 26
  - Min Output Frame: 1 (Should be 1)
  - Gap Analysis: Input ends at 26, Output starts at 1. Offset required.

3.4 Player Roles in Tracking Data:
Defensive Coverage, Other Route Runner, Passer, Targeted Receiver

3.5 Coordinate Bounds (Raw Data):
  - X Range: 1.21 to 119.86
  - Y Range: 0.97 to 52.43

PART 3: WEEK 1 DEEP DIVE & SPARSITY PROOF
-----------------------------------------
3.7 PLAYER DROPOUT & TEMPORAL SPARSITY ANALYSIS

      - Avg Pre-Throw Frames:  28.27
      - Avg Post-Throw Frames: 11.06
      - Conclusion: On average, input files are 2.89x longer than output files.

   B. Entity Dropout (Players vanishing in Output):
      - Total Plays Analyzed: 819
      - Plays with AT LEAST ONE missing player: 819 (100.00%)
      - Avg Missing Players per Play: 9.05
      - Max Missing Players in a single play: 13

   C. Profile of Vanishing Players (Sample):
      Sample Play (Game 2023091004, Play 219):
      Missing 13 players in Output.

      Observation: 0.0% of missing players in this sample are Linemen.
      (Hypothesis: Tracking data often drops interior linemen post-throw if they are not near the play.)
